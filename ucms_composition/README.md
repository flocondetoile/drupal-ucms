# UCMS - Compositon module

This module provides a cleaner, faster and much more flexible dropin replacement
for the *ucms_layout* module.

This module provides a basic upgrade path from the *ucms_layout* module but it
might not fit to everyone's need, that's why it is provided as a Symfony command
rather than a Drupal update function.

# µCMS - Media and content handling module

This brings the following things:

 * media and editorial content handling;
 * administrative UI for content and media using µDashboard;
 * user favorites cart;
 * editorial and media context panes;
 * CKEditor media integration.

# Status

## Todolist

 * [_] performance: lazy load carts with AJAX in pane when user open it
 * [_] reliability: allow to fallback content admin on database when Elastic search is not available

## Pending

 * [_] improvement: get rid of jquery.ui.(droppable,draggable) and replace with dragula

## Postponed

 * [_] improvement, from Lonny: unhardcoded content types (media, editorial) and build a dynamic behavioral system
